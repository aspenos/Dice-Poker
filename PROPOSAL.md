Dice Poker

*Project Description*

My app is called Dice Poker. In the game, the user faces off against a computer, each taking turns rolling five 6-sided dice. The goal is to match classic poker hands with the dice to score points. Each number combination equates to a poker hand, such as a straight, full house, high card, etc. The poker hands are assigned points based on their rarity. Both sides continue taking turns rolling their dice until one player reaches 100 points, winning the game.
