Dice Poker: Dice Poker is a game that merges elements of poker with the randomness of dice rolling. In this game, players compete against a computer to earn the most amount of points by rolling five 6-sided-die. Each roll corresponds to a poker hand and a certain number of points. For example, rolling 6-5-6-5-5 represents the poker hand "Full House" and is worth 15 points. The player and computer take turns rolling the die until either side scores 100 total points, winning the game.   

Technologies Used: Dice Poker utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all within the Visual Studio Code environment, to create a dynamic and interactive gaming experience that runs smoothly in web browsers. HTML is used to structure the game's interface, while CSS adds style and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the game is visually engaging. JavaScript forms the backbone of the game's mechanics, handling the dice rolls, scoring logic, and player interactions in real time. The choice of Visual Studio Code as the development platform enables efficient coding, testing, and debugging, streamlining the game's development process. Designed for web browser play, "Dice Poker" offers easy accessibility and a user-friendly gaming experience across various devices.

Next Steps: 

Building on the foundation of Dice Poker, I am to enhance the player experience through the following long-term goals: Animated dice rolls, customizable dice, audio indicators for accessibility, customizable background image, in-game music, and online functionality. These enhancements aim to deepen player engagement, improve accessibility, and expand the game's functionality. Introducing animations for rolling dice would make the game more visually engaging, bringing the action to life. Customizable dice, background wallpaper, and in-game music would add a personal touch to the experience. Audio cues that signal a win, loss, or tie, as well as in-game music, would add an auditory dimension to the game that furthers the player's immersion. Developing the capability for players to compete with friends online will transform the game from a single-player experience to one that can be enjoyed with friends remotely, expanding the game's reach.
