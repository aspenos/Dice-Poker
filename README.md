Dice Poker: Dice Poker is a game that merges elements of poker with the randomness of dice rolling. In this game, players compete against a computer to earn the most amount of points by rolling five 6-sided-die. Each roll corresponds to a poker hand and a certain number of points. For example, rolling 6-5-6-5-5 represents the poker hand "Full House" and is worth 15 points. The player and computer take turns rolling the die until either side scores 100 total points, winning the game.   

Technologies Used: Dice Poker utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all within the Visual Studio Code environment, to create a dynamic and interactive gaming experience that runs smoothly in web browsers.

JavaScript forms the backbone of the game's mechanics, handling the dice rolls, scoring logic, and player interactions in real time. The choice of Visual Studio Code as the development platform enables efficient coding, testing, and debugging, streamlining the game's development process.
